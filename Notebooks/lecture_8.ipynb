    "2. Concise, Clean, and Modular Code\n",
    "    > If you have multiple tasks to perform, you can create a function for each task. This makes the code more organized and easier to understand. For example, instead of writing 10 lines of code for 10 tasks, you can create functions for each and use them multiple times.\n",
